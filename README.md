<h1 align="center">SS-Quasi-Newton-Optimistix</h1>

This library provides two quasi-Newton optimizers — **SSBFGS** and **SSBroyden** — developed on top of [Optimistix](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/optimistix), a [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax)-based library for nonlinear solvers including root finding, minimization, fixed-point problems, and least-squares optimization.

pip install -U --pre jax jaxlib "jax-cuda12-plugin[with-cuda]" jax-cuda12-pjrt \
  -i https://us-python.pkg.dev/ml-oss-artifacts-published/jax/simple/
```

## Install SS-Quasi-Newton-Optimistix

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/raj-brown/optimistix.git@SSBFGS
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- JAX 0.4.38+
- [Equinox](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox) 0.11.11+

# Quick Example

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
import optimistix as optx


def fn(y, _):
    return 0.5 * (y - jnp.tanh(y + 1)) ** 2


solver = optx.SSBFGS(rtol=1e-5, atol=1e-5)
solver = optx.BestSoFarMinimiser(solver)

sol = optx.minimise(fn, solver, jnp.array(0.0))

assert jnp.allclose(sol.value, 0.96118069, rtol=1e-5, atol=1e-5)
print("Assertion was successful!")
```
